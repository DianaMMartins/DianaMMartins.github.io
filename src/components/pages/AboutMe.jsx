        I'm a software developer with a unique perspective on design and user
        experience. 💻 My journey into coding began when I ventured on creating my
        pastry brand and wanted to create my own website. <br />This lead me to
        learning how to create a website, which in turn, led me down the path of
        coding and eventually to the 👩‍💻 Northcoders Software Developer bootcamp.
        <br /> <br />
        🎓 Throughout my experience at Northcoders, I learned the skills necessary
        to become a full-stack developer, with an emphasis on Javascript and
        React. Having experience in Animation and Multimedia Design and as a Pastry
        Chef, I bring a creative and fresh perspective to this new career path.
        <br /> <br /> Aside from coding, I am also a talented pastry chef and
        enjoy baking delicious treats 🎂 and breads 🥐 in my spare time and sharing
        them with friends and family 🍩. Additionally, I love gardening and find
        joy in starting plants from seed and watching them grow.🪴 <br /> <br />❤ I
        am always eager to learn, grow and explore new worlds! 🕹
