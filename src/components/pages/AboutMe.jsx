        <p>
          I'm a software developer with a unique perspective on design and user
          experience. My journey into coding began when I ventured on creating
          my pastry brand and wanted to create my own website. <br />
          This lead me to learning how to create a website, which in turn, led
          me down the path of coding and eventually to the Northcoders Software
          Developer bootcamp.
          <br /> <br />
          Throughout my experience at Northcoders, I learned the skills
          necessary to become a full-stack developer, with an emphasis on
          Javascript and React. Having experience in Animation and Multimedia
          Design and as a Pastry Chef, I bring a creative and fresh perspective
          to this new career path.
          <br /> <br /> Aside from coding, I am also a talented pastry chef and
          enjoy baking delicious treats and breads in my spare time and sharing
          them with friends and family. Additionally, I love gardening and find
          joy in starting plants from seed and watching them grow. <br /> <br />
          ❤ I am always eager to learn, grow and explore new worlds!
